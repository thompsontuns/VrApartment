This is my take on an apartment that I am submitting for android.
Versions
- Unity 2017.1.0
- GVR Unity SDK v1.60.0


I took my around six hours to complete this project. 
After I had all the models I wanted in place I struggled with the lighting and animating the globe. 
One thing I did like about this project compared to the Carnival was the freedom I had. I got to use the udacity store and choose my own kitchenware and lamps, I got to put things where I wanted, and if I hadn't started the project so late I would've spent many more hours making this apartment look as realistic as possible.
